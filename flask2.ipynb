    "GET Method:\n",
    "\n",
    "The GET method is one of the HTTP methods used by browsers when a user requests a web page or resource.\n",
    "When a browser sends a GET request, it appends data to the URL in the form of query parameters. For example, http://example.com/page?name=John&age=25.\n",
    "It is primarily used for data retrieval and should not have the capacity to change the state of the server.\n",
    "POST Method:\n",
    "\n",
    "The POST method is another HTTP method used for submitting data to be processed to a specified resource.\n",
    "Unlike GET, POST sends data in the HTTP request body, not in the URL. This makes it suitable for sending larger amounts of data and sensitive information, as it is not visible in the URL.\n",
    "POST requests are commonly used when submitting forms on web pages."
