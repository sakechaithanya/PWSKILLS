    "Q1. What is MongoDB? Explain non-relational databases in short. In which scenarios it is preferred to use\n",
    "MongoDB over SQL databases?\n",
    "\n",
    "MongoDB is a popular NoSQL (non-relational) database management system that provides a flexible and scalable way to store and manage data. Unlike traditional relational databases, MongoDB uses a document-oriented data model, where data is stored in BSON (Binary JSON) documents. These documents are grouped together in collections, and each document can have a different structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "Non-relational Databases:\n",
    "Non-relational databases, also known as NoSQL databases, diverge from the traditional relational database model by not using a fixed schema, allowing for more flexible and dynamic data storage. They are designed to handle large volumes of unstructured or semi-structured data, making them suitable for various types of applications and use cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "Scenarios for Choosing MongoDB over SQL Databases:\n",
    "\n",
    "Schema Flexibility:\n",
    "\n",
    "MongoDB allows for dynamic and flexible schemas. Each document in a collection can have a different structure, making it well-suited for applications where the data schema evolves over time.\n",
    "Scalability:\n",
    "\n",
    "MongoDB is designed to scale horizontally, which means it can handle increasing amounts of data and traffic by adding more servers to a distributed database. This makes it a good choice for applications with growing data and user loads.\n",
    "Document-Oriented Model:\n",
    "\n",
    "The document-oriented model of MongoDB is a natural fit for certain types of data, especially those with complex and nested structures. JSON-like documents can represent data in a way that aligns well with the programming models used in modern application development.\n",
    "Handling Large Amounts of Data:\n",
    "\n",
    "MongoDB is well-suited for handling large amounts of unstructured or semi-structured data. It can efficiently store and retrieve data without the need for a predefined schema.\n",
    "Agile Development and Iterative Changes:\n",
    "\n",
    "MongoDB's flexible schema allows developers to make changes to the data model without requiring a major database overhaul. This is beneficial in agile development environments where requirements may evolve during the development process.\n",
    "Geospatial Capabilities:\n",
    "\n",
    "MongoDB has built-in support for geospatial data, making it a good choice for applications that involve location-based services.\n",
    "Developer Productivity:\n",
    "\n",
    "MongoDB's query language is rich and expressive, making it easy for developers to work with. Additionally, its use of BSON (Binary JSON) aligns well with the data structures used in many programming languages."

    "Q2. State and Explain the features of MongoDB.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "MongoDB is a feature-rich NoSQL database management system that offers a range of capabilities to meet the needs of modern application development. Here are some key features of MongoDB:\n",
    "\n",
    "Document-Oriented:\n",
    "\n",
    "MongoDB stores data in BSON (Binary JSON) documents, which are JSON-like, hierarchical data structures. This document-oriented approach allows for flexible and dynamic schemas.\n",
    "Schema Flexibility:\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike traditional relational databases, MongoDB doesn't require a predefined schema. Each document in a collection can have a different structure, allowing for easy modification and evolution of the data model.\n",
    "Dynamic Schema:\n",
    "\n",
    "MongoDB supports dynamic schemas, allowing fields to be added to documents on the fly. This flexibility is particularly useful in agile development environments where requirements may change frequently.\n",
    "JSON/BSON Format:\n",
    "\n",
    "Data is stored in BSON, a binary representation of JSON. This format supports rich data types, including arrays and nested documents, providing a natural way to represent complex data structures.\n",
    "Scalability:\n",
    "\n",
    "MongoDB is designed to scale horizontally by sharding, distributing data across multiple servers. This enables it to handle large amounts of data and high traffic loads, making it a scalable solution for growing applications.\n",
    "Indexes:\n",
    "\n",
    "MongoDB supports various types of indexes, including compound indexes and geospatial indexes, to optimize query performance. Indexes enhance the speed of data retrieval by allowing the database to quickly locate and access specific documents.\n",
    "Query Language:\n",
    "\n",
    "MongoDB provides a powerful and expressive query language that supports a wide range of queries, including filtering, sorting, and aggregation. The query language is designed to be intuitive and easy for developers to work with.\n",
    "Aggregation Framework:\n",
    "\n",
    "MongoDB includes a robust aggregation framework that allows for the processing and transformation of data within the database. It supports complex data manipulations, such as filtering, grouping, and projecting.\n",
    "Ad Hoc Queries:\n",
    "\n",
    "MongoDB supports ad hoc queries, enabling developers to query and analyze data without the need for predefined views or stored procedures. This flexibility is beneficial during the development and testing phases.\n",
    "Geospatial Capabilities:\n",
    "\n",
    "MongoDB includes geospatial indexes and queries, making it suitable for applications that involve location-based data. This is useful for scenarios such as mapping and geolocation services.\n",
    "High Availability and Replication:\n",
    "\n",
    "MongoDB supports automatic data replication and failover to ensure high availability. Replication allows for the creation of redundant copies of data across multiple servers, reducing the risk of data loss and downtime.\n",
    "Security Features:\n",
    "\n",
    "MongoDB provides features such as authentication, authorization, and encryption to ensure the security of data. Access control mechanisms help restrict users' access to specific databases or operations.\n",
    "GridFS:\n",
    "\n",
    "MongoDB includes GridFS, a specification for storing and retrieving large files, such as images and videos. This is particularly useful for applications that require efficient storage and retrieval of large binary data."
