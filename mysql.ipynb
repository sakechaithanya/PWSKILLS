    "Q1. What is a database? Differentiate between SQL and NoSQL databases.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "A database is a structured collection of data that is organized and stored in a way that allows for efficient retrieval, updating, and management of information. Databases are used to store and manage large amounts of data, making it easier to organize, access, and analyze information.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are various types of databases, but they generally fall into two main categories: relational databases and non-relational databases (NoSQL databases).\n",
    "\n",
    "Differentiate between SQL and NoSQL databases.\n",
    "\n",
    "SQL Databases:\n",
    "\n",
    "SQL databases, also known as relational databases, use a structured query language (SQL) for defining and manipulating the data. They are based on a fixed schema, which means the structure of the data (tables, columns, and relationships) is defined in advance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key features of SQL databases include:\n",
    "\n",
    "Structured Data: Data in SQL databases is structured and follows a tabular format with predefined schemas.\n",
    "\n",
    "ACID Properties: SQL databases adhere to ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) properties, ensuring data integrity in transactions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Scalability: SQL databases can be scaled vertically by increasing the power of the existing hardware, but it can be challenging to scale horizontally.\n",
    "\n",
    "Examples: MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, Microsoft SQL Server.\n",
    "\n",
    "NoSQL Databases:\n",
    "\n",
    "NoSQL databases, as the name suggests, don't use SQL for querying and manipulating data. They are designed to handle large volumes of unstructured or semi-structured data and provide more flexibility in terms of data models.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key features of NoSQL databases include:\n",
    "\n",
    "Schema-less: NoSQL databases are schema-less or schema-flexible, allowing for the storage of unstructured or semi-structured data.\n",
    "\n",
    "CAP Theorem: NoSQL databases are often designed with a focus on the CAP (Consistency, Availability, Partition Tolerance) theorem, providing different trade-offs between these three aspects.\n",
    "\n",
    "Scalability: NoSQL databases are generally more easily scalable horizontally, making them suitable for handling large amounts of data and traffic.\n",
    "\n",
    "Examples: MongoDB, Cassandra, CouchDB, Redis."

    "DDL stands for Data Definition Language. It is a subset of SQL (Structured Query Language) used to define and manage the structure of a database. DDL statements are responsible for defining, modifying, and deleting the structure of database objects such as tables, indexes, and constraints.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some common DDL statements:\n",
    "\n",
    "CREATE: Used to create a new database object, such as a table, index, or view.\n",
    "\n",
    "CREATE TABLE employees (\n",
    "    emp_id INT PRIMARY KEY,\n",

    "\n",
    "ALTER TABLE employees\n",
    "ADD emp_department VARCHAR(50);\n",
    "\n",
    "DROP: Used to delete an existing database object, such as a table or index.\n",
    "\n",
    "DROP TABLE employees;\n",
    "\n",
    "TRUNCATE: Used to remove all records from a table, but unlike DELETE, it does not log individual row deletions and is generally faster for removing all records from a table.\n",

The primary DQL statement is the SELECT statement, which is used to specify the columns to be retrieved and the conditions for retrieving data from one or more tables.\n",

    "Explanation with an Example:\n",

    "SELECT:\n",

    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "Suppose you have a \"employees\" table with columns emp_id, emp_name, emp_salary, and emp_department. To retrieve the names and salaries of employees in the \"IT\" department with a salary greater than 50000, you could use the following SELECT statement:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "SELECT emp_name, emp_salary\n",
    "FROM employees\n",
    "WHERE emp_department = 'IT' AND emp_salary > 50000;\n",

    "\n",
    "A primary key is a field or a set of fields in a database table that uniquely identifies each record in the table. It must be unique for each record and cannot contain NULL values. The primary key serves as a reference point for establishing relationships between tables, enforcing data integrity, and providing a fast way to access and retrieve data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key characteristics of a primary key:\n",
    "\n",
    "Uniqueness: Each value in the primary key must be unique within the table.\n",
    "Non-null: A primary key cannot contain NULL values, ensuring that each record has a unique identifier.\n",
    "Immutable: Ideally, the values in a primary key should not change over time to maintain consistency in relationships.\n",
    "\n",
    "A foreign key is a field in a database table that is used to establish a link between two tables. It creates a relationship between the tables by referencing the primary key of another table. The foreign key ensures referential integrity, meaning that the values in the foreign key column must correspond to the values in the primary key of the referenced table or be NULL.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key characteristics of a foreign key:\n",
    "\n",
    "Referential Integrity: The values in the foreign key column must correspond to the values in the primary key of the referenced table.\n",
    "Relation between Tables: It establishes a link between tables, indicating a relationship between the data in those tables.\n",
    "Can Contain NULL: In some cases, a foreign key can contain NULL values, indicating that no corresponding record exists in the referenced table."
