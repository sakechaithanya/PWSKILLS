    "Q1. What is Web Scraping? Why is it Used? Give three areas where Web Scraping is used to get data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Web Scraping:\n",
    "Web scraping is the process of extracting data from websites. It involves fetching web pages, parsing the HTML content, and extracting information for various purposes. Web scraping is used to automate the extraction of data from websites, especially when the data is not easily accessible through APIs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why is it Used?\n",
    "\n",
    "Data Collection: Web scraping is used to collect large amounts of data from websites efficiently. This data could include product prices, news articles, social media posts, and more.\n",
    "\n",
    "Competitor Analysis: Businesses use web scraping to gather information about their competitors, such as pricing strategies, product listings, and customer reviews.\n",
    "\n",
    "Research and Analysis: Researchers use web scraping to collect data for academic and market research. It provides a way to gather relevant information from diverse sources.\n",
    "\n",
    "Monitoring and Tracking: Web scraping is employed to monitor changes on websites, track prices of products, or gather information on stock market fluctuations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q2. What are the different methods used for Web Scraping?\n",
    "\n",
    "Several methods are used for web scraping, including:\n",
    "\n",
    "Regular Expressions (Regex): Regex can be used to match and extract specific patterns from HTML content.\n",
    "\n",
    "HTML Parsing: Parsing HTML using libraries like BeautifulSoup and lxml to navigate and extract data from the HTML structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "XPath: XPath is a language used for navigating XML documents but is also applicable to HTML. It provides a way to select elements using path expressions.\n",
    "\n",
    "CSS Selectors: Similar to XPath, CSS selectors can be used to select HTML elements based on their attributes.\n",
    "\n",
    "APIs: Some websites provide APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) that allow direct access to their data. However, not all websites offer APIs, and web scraping may be necessary.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q3. What is Beautiful Soup? Why is it used?\n",
    "\n",
    "Beautiful Soup:\n",
    "Beautiful Soup is a Python library for pulling data out of HTML and XML files. It provides Pythonic idioms for iterating, searching, and modifying the parse tree, making it easy to navigate and scrape data from web pages.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why is it used?\n",
    "\n",
    "Beautiful Soup simplifies the process of web scraping by providing Pythonic methods to search and navigate the parse tree. It helps in converting complex HTML documents into a tree of Python objects, allowing developers to extract required information more easily.\n",
    "Q4. Why is Flask used in this Web Scraping project?\n",
    "\n",
    "Flask is likely used in a web scraping project to create a web application that displays the scraped data or provides an interface for users to initiate and control the scraping process. Flask can serve as the backend for the application, handling requests, and rendering HTML templates. It provides a simple and lightweight framework for building web applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q5. Write the names of AWS services used in this project. Also, explain the use of each service.\n",
    "\n",
    "The use of AWS services in a web scraping project depends on the specific requirements and architecture. Here are some AWS services that could be relevant:\n",
    "\n",
    "Amazon EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud):\n",
    "\n",
    "Use: EC2 instances could be used to host the web scraping script and Flask application. EC2 provides scalable compute capacity in the cloud.\n",
    "Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Service):\n",
    "\n",
    "Use: S3 can be used to store and manage the data scraped from websites. It offers scalable, durable, and secure object storage.\n",
    "Amazon RDS (Relational Database Service):\n",
    "\n",
    "Use: If the project involves storing structured data, RDS can be used to host a relational database to store and manage the scraped data.\n",
    "Amazon DynamoDB:\n",
    "\n",
    "Use: For projects with NoSQL database requirements, DynamoDB can be used to store and retrieve the scraped data.\n",
    "Amazon API Gateway:\n",
    "\n",
    "Use: If the Flask application serves as an API for the scraped data, API Gateway can be used to create, publish, and manage APIs.\n",
    "AWS Lambda:\n",
    "\n",
    "Use: Lambda functions can be used for serverless execution of specific tasks, such as running periodic web scraping jobs.\n",
    "Amazon CloudWatch:\n",
    "\n",
    "Use: CloudWatch can be used for monitoring and logging of AWS resources, including EC2 instances, Lambda functions, and more.\n",
    "Amazon Route 53:\n",
    "\n",
    "Use: If the Flask application is hosted on EC2, Route 53 can be used for domain registration and DNS management."
